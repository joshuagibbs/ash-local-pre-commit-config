## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

A robust script that can be run locally on your machine to configure a Git pre-commit hook in your repository. This hook uses the AWS Automated Security Helper (ASH) tool to scan your code for security issues before any commit is accepted, helping you maintain secure coding practices.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine so you can have automated scanning of your code repos before committing changes.

### Prerequisites

This project is designed to run on MacOS and assumes the following pre-requisites are in place:

- You have a Docker compatible runtime running locally on your machine such as:
  * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  * [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) - configured to use Docker runtime
  * [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) - configured to use dockerd
  * [Podman](https://podman.io/) - with podman-docker installed
- You have cloned the repo for the [AWS Automated Security Helper (ASH)](https://github.com/awslabs/automated-security-helper) tool.
- The repo where you want to implement the git pre-commit hook is a valid git repository.

### Installing

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuagibbs/ash-local-pre-commit-config.git
cd ash-local-pre-commit-config
```

Make sure that ash-config.sh is executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./ash-config.sh
```

Execute ash-config.sh against your repo:

```bash
# Basic usage
./ash-config.sh /path/to/your/repo

# With custom Git folder location
./ash-config.sh --git-folder /custom/path/to/git/folder /path/to/your/repo

# Show help
./ash-config.sh --help
```

This copies the pre-commit file into the .git/hooks directory in your repo which creates a git pre-commit hook. Any existing pre-commit hook will be backed up.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

When you commit code changes, the pre-commit hook automatically scans your code using [ASH](https://github.com/awslabs/automated-security-helper). The code must pass all ASH security checks before the commit is accepted.

### Enhanced Scan Output

The hook now provides detailed, color-coded output with comprehensive information:

#### During Scanning
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates showing scan progress and file counts
- **Visual Indicators**: Spinner or detailed progress monitoring based on configuration
- **Current Activity**: Display of files being processed (when real-time monitoring enabled)

#### Scan Results Display
When security issues are found, the hook displays:

1. **Detailed File Information**: 
   - Specific file paths with security issues
   - Line numbers where problems are detected
   - Precise issue descriptions

2. **Severity-based Grouping** (when enabled):
   - üö® **Critical Issues** - Immediate security threats
   - üî¥ **High Severity** - Significant security risks  
   - üü° **Medium Severity** - Moderate security concerns
   - üîµ **Low Severity** - Minor security improvements
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informational** - Security best practice suggestions

3. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Total number of files scanned
   - Count of issues by severity level
   - Overall scan completion status

#### Example Enhanced Output
```
üîç Real-time scan progress:
[15 files] 3 issues found...
‚úÖ Scan completed! Processed 15 items.

üìä Detailed Security Scan Results:

### Successful Scans
When no security issues are found:
```
‚úÖ ASH security check passed!
```

All scan activity is automatically logged to `.git/logs/pre-commit.log` with timestamps for audit purposes.

### Bypassing the Hook

In emergency situations, you can bypass the ASH check by setting the `SKIP_ASH` environment variable:

```bash
SKIP_ASH=1 git commit -m "Emergency fix"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration <a name = "configuration"></a>

### ASH Configuration Script Options
